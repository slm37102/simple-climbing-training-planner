# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## What this is

A single-user, offline-first **PWA** that prescribes a periodized climbing training macrocycle (Base → Build → Peak → Taper) for one intermediate climber (V5–V6 boulder / ~7a lead) doing both bouldering and sport. **Vanilla HTML / CSS / JS ES modules — no build step, no bundler, no npm runtime deps, no test framework.** Optional Firebase Auth (Google) + Firestore sync.

## Weighing work

**Code is cheap here — do NOT weigh development/implementation time as a cost** when recommending whether to build something. "It's a lot of work" / "poor ROI for the effort" / "too many hours to save a few minutes" are not valid arguments in this repo. Judge a build/don't-build call purely on: does it improve training outcomes for this one athlete, is it correct, is it safe (G3 durability outranks everything), is the evidence real (not uncited convention dressed as behaviour), and does the *ongoing* complexity earn its place (the `project-goals.md` "simple over clever" principle — a maintenance/surface-area cost, distinct from build time). If the only thing arguing against a feature is how long it'd take to write, build it.

## Commands

There is **no build, no lint, no `package.json`**. Everything is served as static files.

```powershell
# Run locally — any static server pointed at repo root:
npx http-server . -p 8765 -c-1
# or
python -m http.server 8765
```

Then open `http://127.0.0.1:8765/` and click **"Use locally only"** on the auth gate. The service worker only activates over `https://` or `localhost`.

**Tests** are an in-browser smoke suite at `tests/index.html`, no CLI runner. See the `test` skill for how to run it, what it covers, Playwright MCP notes, and this dev machine's environment quirks (stale `node`/`npx`/`python` PATH, Playwright MCP connection order).

## Deploy

Static host anywhere; canonical target is Firebase Hosting. See the `deploy` skill for the command, auto-deploy pipeline, and hosting URL.

## Architecture

`js/app.js` is the entry point: registers the service worker, wires tab nav, gates on auth, and mounts views. Tabs map to renderers in `js/views/*.js`. **There is no framework** — each renderer takes `(root)`, replaces `#view`'s `innerHTML`, then wires its own listeners via `data-*` attributes; views import the domain singletons (`Storage`, `Program`, `Loads`, …) directly as ES modules. Re-rendering on state change = re-calling the view function.

Data flow is layered:

```
js/views/*   → read Storage.get(), Program.*, Loads.*   (pure read of plan + math)
             → write via Storage.setDay / setPlanSettings / setGlobalBenchmarks
js/storage.js→ LocalStorage is the source of truth; emits change events
js/sync.js   → subscribes Storage.onChange, debounced 800ms upload to
               Firestore users/{uid}/state/main; onSnapshot merges remote back
               via Storage.mergeRemote (per-plan, per-day Last-Write-Wins on updatedAt)
```

### Domain model (the parts that need multiple files to understand)

The training logic lives in two modules and is grounded in `docs/training-philosophy.md` + the ADRs in `docs/adr/`. **Read those before changing prescriptions** — the values are deliberate, evidence-based, and sometimes intentionally softened from the source frameworks (Lattice / Hörst / Anderson) for this athlete's injury risk. **Also read `docs/knowledge-gaps.md`**: known doc/code divergences are tracked there with stable KG-* IDs and a status per gap — don't "fix" a divergence without checking its gap entry first. Project goals live in `docs/project-goals.md`.

- **`js/program.js`** — the macrocycle. `Program.build(plan, dateISO)` is the primary entry point: it resolves the date to a `{weekIdx, phase, deload, retest, flavor, slot}` context, then builds the prescribed session (exercise list with prescriptions, but no kg yet).
- **`js/loads.js`** — turns prescribed % ranges + benchmarks into kg, then applies the adjustment chain.

### Key invariants (preserve these when editing)

- **Cycle length is configurable, not fixed.** `settings.cycleWeeks` (default 12, clamped 8–40 via `clampCycleWeeks`). The phase split is **derived** from length by `buildPhasePattern(weeks, peakType)` — never hardcode a 12-element pattern. Single block ≤ 20 weeks; **double block** (two Base→Build cycles) above the `DOUBLE_BLOCK_THRESHOLD` of 20. Peak is fixed at 2 weeks; Taper length comes from `settings.peakType` (ADR-0007: `'comp'` → 1 wk, `'trip'`/`'project'` → 2 wk). Index into `Program.phasePattern(settings)`; don't re-derive phases. (See `docs/adr/0002`.) `PHASE_PATTERN` is still exported as `buildPhasePattern(12)` (comp) for back-compat callers.
- **Post-build session shaping is a registered pipeline.** `PRESCRIPTION_PASSES` in `js/program.js` runs in registration order (anti-style cue → base ramp → deload cut → taper cut → forced cut → readiness gate), and every `prescribeForContext` path exits through `finishSession`, which returns a fresh copy (shared constants never escape by reference), applies the same ctx-enrichment skeleton to every in-cycle return, and collects `session.notes[]` from the pass note fields in pass order. **Notes are NOT mutually exclusive** — a deload week can also be a Lighter readiness day (ADR-0015) — so views render the whole array, never `a || b || c`. Target provenance lives on the exercise (`originalTarget` for cuts, `rampedFrom` for the ramp, `readinessScaledFrom` for the readiness gate); Today's target callout gives the readiness step priority when present. Rest/Tue/Sun slots return before the pipeline — they are exempt by construction.
- **Deload = volume cut, intensity held; cadence is 3:1.** The intensity/volume split was inverted historically. Deload weeks land every **4th** week within Base/Build (`(i+1)%4` — ADR-0004) plus the forced retest-deload at the end of each Base block; they cut `prescribedSets` ~40% (`applyDeloadVolume` in `program.js`) and append a note to prescription text; kg is **not** scaled — `Loads.resolveEffective` has no deload parameter at all. (See `docs/adr/0003` + `0004`.) Retest weeks are exempt from the volume cut **only on Monday** (the retest protocol itself, not a volume-cuttable template) — Thu/Sat sessions in a retest week still take the same cut (KG-B10). Taper weeks get the same sets cut via `applyTaperVolume` (`taperNote`, ADR-0007) — intensity stays near-peak there too.
- **The cycle is anchored two ways.** `settings.anchorMode: 'startDate' | 'compDate'`. To answer "what cycle context is this date in?", call **`Program.resolveForSettings(settings, dateISO)`** — the one public door that derives `effectiveStart`, the clamped `cycleWeeks`, and `peakType` itself (the positional `resolveDate` stays for internals/tests; its silently-defaulted `peakType` mis-shapes trip/project plans if a caller forgets it). Never read `settings.startDate` directly in views — start comes from `Program.effectiveStart(settings)`. In `compDate` mode, start = `compDate − (cycleWeeks × 7 − 1)` days, so the final taper day lands on the comp date. The day before the final cycle day is a forced rest day (`rest-pre-goal`, ADR-0007), whatever weekday it is. In `startDate` mode, `settings.scheduleShiftDays` (ADR-0008) pushes `effectiveStart` forward — set by the Today-tab gap banner (`js/replan.js`'s `Replan.detectGap`) when the athlete accepts extending the plan after a missed-session gap; re-snapped to Monday (C1) after shifting. Ignored entirely in `compDate` mode — the goal date is fixed, so a gap there is surfaced as information only, never an automatic shift.
- **Hangboard prescriptions are phase-shaped (ADR-0005/0006).** Base Monday = a two-exercise pair (7/3 repeaters + intro max-hangs at 55–70%); Build = weighted max-hangs 2×4 @ RPE 8–9; min-edge is deleted — don't reintroduce it. Sport-flavor Thursdays: Build = 60/60 threshold (RPE ≤8.5), Peak = 30/30 lactic (RPE 9.5–10, only phase allowed to carry it); interval rest strings tighten 5s/week inside the final 4 weeks via `densityRest(weeksLeft)`.
- **Hybrid mode mixes within the week, not across it, in Base+Build (ADR-0010).** `weekFlavor` no longer picks the whole week's identity in those two phases — it picks the *format* inside a fixed-system slot. Base needs no override (`sat-flash-pyramid`/`sat-arc` already alternate by week, both aerobic). Build's override lives in `prescribeForContext` (`hybridBuildMix = focus === 'hybrid' && phase === 'build'`), never inside the builders: Thursday is always `thu-limit`; Saturday alternates `sat-boulder-triples` (odd/boulder weeks) with `sat-6060-threshold` (even/sport weeks — shares its exercise content with `thu-6060-threshold` via the `SIXTY_SIXTY_EXERCISE` constant; don't let the two drift apart). `sat-4x4-build` no longer appears in hybrid mode at all — sport-focus only. Peak/Taper and non-hybrid focuses are untouched.
- **Day-of-week determines the session slot, not cycle position.** `Program.resolveDate` uses `d.getDay()` to map Mon→`mon-main`, Thu/Sat→main, Wed/Fri→`rest`, Tue→`tue-light`, Sun→`sun-optional`. A non-Monday `startDate` therefore shifts which calendar day is "Wk 1 Mon-main".
- **Percentages are of TOTAL system load, not added weight alone (ADR-0013).** `prescribeLoadKg` computes `added = pct × (bodyweight + benchmark) − bodyweight` for both `hangboard` and `pullup` kinds. **`benchmarks.bodyweight` is required** — when it's unset, `prescribeLoadKg`/`resolveEffective` return `null` outright (never a silent fallback to the old added-only math); views must show a "set bodyweight" hint (see `today.js`'s `bwHint`). The KG-B11a negative-benchmark clamp (`clampToBenchmark`) still runs but is now belt-and-braces — under total-load math a realistic (<1.0) band naturally stays safe for an assisted athlete.
- **Load math chain (in `Loads.resolveEffective`, in order):** `prescribeLoadKg` (% range from benchmarks) → seed by previous-actual kg if present, else range midpoint → `layoffDecay` (ADR-0008: ×1.0 within a 10-day grace period since that session type was last logged, else −3%/week floored at ×0.85 — guards against resuming at full load after a layoff) → `autoAdjust` ±5% (previous avg RPE vs target `rpeRange`), upgraded to **+2.5% when RPE is in range AND `Loads.targetsHit` says the previous actual met today's prescribed sets/reps** (ADR-0009 — views call `Loads.resolveForDay` (exercise + index + sessionId + date + `Storage.listDays()`), which owns the previous-same-session scan and always feeds the full previous actual through, so the progression can't be silently disabled by a forgotten field; `resolveEffective` remains the pure internal/test door) → readiness multiplier (×0.85 / ×1.0 / ×1.05, or 0 = suggest rest) → **upward cap: total move ≤ +5% of the decayed previous actual per session** (ADR-0009; downward is never capped). Each step appends to `reason[]` for the UI tooltip. **No deload multiplier here** (see above).
- **Base aerobic sessions ramp volume within the phase (ADR-0009).** In Base, sessions whose `energySystem` starts with "Aerobic" (route pyramid, ARC) get `prescribedTarget` scaled ×(1 + 0.10×(hardWeekPos−1)), capped ×1.30, via `applyBaseVolumeRamp` + `hardPhasePos` in `program.js`; the pre-ramp value lands in `rampedFrom` (NOT `originalTarget` — that field means "deload/taper cut" to the views) and a `rampNote` is set. Deload/retest weeks are exempt (`hardPhasePos` → null) so the deload cut always scales the unramped template; anaerobic Base sessions are deliberately excluded while KG-B12 is open. After editing `js/program.js`, regenerate the schedule section of `docs/training-plan.md` with `node tools/generate-schedule.mjs`.
- **`exercise.kind` drives both rendering and load logic.** Only `hangboard` and `pullup` compute kg (`loadPctRange` against `maxHang20mm` / `pullup1RM`). `antagonist-block` has nested `items[]`. `test`, `boulder`, `route`, `circuit`, `arc`, `open-climb`, `mobility`, `skill`, `limit-boulder`, `campus` are prescription-text-only — don't try to compute kg for them.
- **`js/exercise-inputs.js` is the single source of truth for which inputs to show.** `today.js` imports `inputVisibility(ex)` → `{ kg, sets, reps, rpe, optional, none }` and `repsLabel(ex)` (`'min'` for `arc`/`open-climb`, else `'reps'`). Never hardcode per-kind UI rules in a view — extend the sets in this helper (`NO_INPUT_KINDS`, `KG_KINDS`, `NO_SETS_KINDS`).
- **The Log tab is a read-only feed — editing happens on Today.** `log.js`'s in-feed edit form was removed deliberately (it was a second, drift-prone copy of Today's logging surface); editing a past day = navigating the Today tab to that date. Don't reintroduce an edit form in Log. The `missed` status is set from Today's status row (`#markMissed`) — the Calendar's missed-dot depends on it.
- **`exercise.optional: true`** hides all numeric inputs and renders a single "Done ✓" checkbox; the stored field is `actual.done: boolean`.
- **Today tab supports prev/next/jump-to-today navigation.** The selected ISO date lives in `sessionStorage['todaySelectedDate']` (resets on browser close — intentional). Use the view's `getSelectedDate()` when prescribing the visible session, not `today()`.

## Storage, schema & migrations

`js/storage.js` versions a single LocalStorage blob (`SCHEMA_VERSION`, currently **6**). `migrate(s)` runs on every load; each step must be **idempotent and bump `s.version`** at its end.

- **Multi-plan shape (v4+):** state is `{ version, activePlanId, plans: {id: plan}, globalSettings, globalBenchmarks }`. Each plan has its own `settings`, `days`, and (legacy) `benchmarks`.
- **Benchmarks are GLOBAL (v5+).** `Storage.get().benchmarks` returns `state.globalBenchmarks`, and `setBenchmarks` shims to `setGlobalBenchmarks`. The per-plan `setPlanBenchmarks(planId, patch, {archive})` still exists but has **zero callers** — dead code kept for the legacy per-plan shape.
- **Retest saves APPEND history; ad-hoc edits OVERWRITE (v6+, ADR-0014).** `Storage.saveRetestBenchmarks(patch, date)` — used by every retest-save path (`today.js`'s "Save as Benchmark" button, shared by the Base-block retest and the ADR-0012 post-goal retest) — pushes a dated `{date, maxHang20mm, pullup1RM}` snapshot onto `globalBenchmarks.history` before applying the patch, feeding the retest-trajectory monitoring signal. Plain `setGlobalBenchmarks` (manual Profile edits) still just overwrites, no history entry — don't conflate the two paths.
- **Plan-scoped setters have legacy + new arities.** `getDay`/`setDay`/`deleteDay`/`listDays` accept both the old "active-plan" form (`setDay(date, patch)`) and the new explicit form (`setDay(planId, date, patch)`).
- **`actual` is always a structured object** `{ kg, sets, reps, rpe, done, raw }`. Legacy strings like `"5x2 @ 62kg RPE 9"` are auto-parsed by `parseLegacyActual`. New code reads structured fields — never regex-parse strings. The human-readable display string is **derived** in `log.js`, never persisted.
- **`Storage.mergeRemote` must NOT emit change events** — emitting would re-trigger upload and loop. It guards with an internal `suppressEmit` counter. It also **prunes local empty plans not present in remote** and syncs `activePlanId`; preserve this or login will silently re-add phantom "Plan 1" entries.
- **Expansion state is intentionally ephemeral.** `log.js` keeps `expandedSet` in memory only — never persist it.

### When you add a field or file

- New `settings` field → add to `defaultSettings()` AND rely on `migrate()`'s shallow-merge to backfill loaded state (keep the existing pattern — `peakType` shipped this way with no schema bump).
- **`sw.js` is derived, not hand-maintained: run `node tools/generate-sw.mjs --bump` after changing anything under `js/`** (and after a `SCHEMA_VERSION` bump in `js/storage.js`). It regenerates the `SHELL` array from the files on disk — a new/renamed `js/` file is picked up automatically — and increments the `CACHE` version so PWA clients fetch the new JS. Run without `--bump` to sync `SHELL` only.

## Conventions

- **ES modules, relative paths, explicit `.js` extensions** — the browser resolves them directly; nothing rewrites imports.
- **Dates are ISO `YYYY-MM-DD` strings everywhere.** Parse with `new Date(iso + 'T00:00:00')` to avoid UTC drift. Date math lives in `js/dates.js` (`localIso`/`today`/`addDays`/`daysBetween`/`snapToMonday`) — every module imports from there; never re-implement these helpers locally (the old view-local copies were migrated out deliberately). Human-readable date *formatters* stay view-local — they're presentation, not math.
- **User-typed strings are escaped at render.** Plan names, session/exercise notes, and anything else the athlete can type must go through `escHtml` (`js/ui.js`) when interpolated into `innerHTML` — notes sync across devices via Firestore, so an unescaped interpolation is not just self-XSS. Program-authored template text (exercise names, prescriptions) is trusted.
- **View pattern:** replace `root.innerHTML`, then call a `wire(...)` function that attaches listeners by `data-*` attribute. No virtual DOM, no templating library.
- **Tap-friendly inputs:** pill selectors and steppers (in `today.js`, styled in `css/styles.css`) are the standard idiom for numeric input — use them over bare `<input type="number">`. Suggested loads are tap-to-prefill buttons (`data-suggest-btn` / `data-suggest-kg`).
- **`firebase-config.js` is intentionally public.** The `apiKey` is a project identifier, not a secret; security is enforced by `firestore.rules` (`request.auth.uid == uid`). Don't move it to env vars or try to hide it. Set `SYNC_ENABLED = false` there for a local-only build.
- **`sw.js` bypasses Firestore / Auth / gstatic URLs explicitly** (see the regex) — the Firebase SDK handles its own offline persistence; don't cache those.

## Common entry points for changes

- New training session type → `js/program.js` (`buildMonHangboard` / `buildThuMain` / `buildSatMain`); add a new `kind` if it has unique inputs, then register that kind in `js/exercise-inputs.js`.
- Change which inputs a kind shows → `js/exercise-inputs.js` only (both Today + Log pick it up).
- Change load calculation → `js/loads.js`.
- New input UI → renderer in `js/views/today.js` (`renderExercise`) + CSS. (Log is read-only — there is no edit form to mirror.)
- New post-build session mutation (a deload-like cut, a note, a swap) → register a pass in `PRESCRIPTION_PASSES` in `js/program.js`, not an if-block in `prescribeForContext`.
- New top-level tab → register in the `views` map in `js/app.js`, add a `<button data-view="X">` in `index.html`, create `js/views/X.js`, then `node tools/generate-sw.mjs --bump`.
- New monitoring signal (ADR-0014) → the signal function in `js/monitoring.js` plus, if its response mutates the plan, an `actionKey` case in `acceptSettingsPatch` — both the Today banner and the Log panel consume signals through `Monitoring.activeSignals`/`dismissPatch`/`acceptSettingsPatch`, so no view code is needed for a new advisory signal.
- New limiter/norm comparison (ADR-0011) → `js/limiter.js`'s `limiterReadout(benchmarks)` — a pure function returning `{lines, caveat}` or `null`; consumed by the Profile-tab card, which recomputes on any benchmark change. Informational only — never wire a limiter verdict into a prescription path.

## Disclaimer

The training content is not medical advice; that framing is intentional and surfaced in the app.
